const faqs = [
  { question: 'Is split rail good for keeping dogs in?', answer: 'Split rail alone has large gaps between rails, so small dogs can slip through. However, we can add welded wire mesh to the inside of the fence to contain pets while keeping the rustic split rail look on the outside.' },
  { question: 'How long does split rail fencing last?', answer: 'Pressure-treated split rail typically lasts 15-20 years. Cedar split rail can last longer due to natural rot resistance. Both are excellent long-term investments for property boundaries.' },
  { question: 'Is split rail cheaper than privacy fencing?', answer: 'Yes, significantly. Split rail uses less material and installs faster, making it typically 50-70% less expensive per foot than a full privacy fence. It is ideal for larger properties where privacy is not the primary goal.' },
