const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is the difference between cedar and pressure-treated wood?', answer: 'Cedar is naturally rot-resistant, lighter, and has a premium appearance — but costs more. Pressure-treated wood is chemically treated to resist rot at a lower price point. Both make great fences; it comes down to budget and aesthetics.' },
  { question: 'When can I stain my pressure-treated fence?', answer: 'Wait 3-6 months for the wood to dry before staining. A simple water test tells you when it is ready — sprinkle water on the wood. If it beads up, wait longer. If it soaks in, you are good to stain.' },
  { question: 'Will pressure-treated wood warp?', answer: 'Some movement is normal as the wood dries. We minimize warping by using properly graded lumber, installing with the right fasteners, and allowing proper spacing. Premium-grade lumber warps less than economy boards.' },
  { question: 'How much does a wood privacy fence cost?', answer: 'Wood privacy fencing is the most affordable solid-board option, typically less than cedar or vinyl. Use our instant quote tool for pricing specific to your project.' },
