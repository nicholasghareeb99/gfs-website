  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "When can I stain my new pressure-treated fence?",
      "answer": "Wait 6-12 months before staining or sealing pressure-treated wood. The lumber needs time to dry and cure after treatment. Staining too early traps moisture and can cause peeling and wood damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does pressure-treated wood last?",
      "answer": "With proper maintenance (staining every 2-3 years), expect 15-20 years of service. The ACQ treatment protects against rot and insects, but wood still needs protection from UV damage and moisture."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pressure-treated wood safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. Modern ACQ (Alkaline Copper Quaternary) treatment replaced the older CCA (chromated copper arsenate) treatment in 2003. ACQ is considered safe for residential use and is approved for playground equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I choose cedar or treated pine?",
      "answer": "Cedar costs more upfront but requires less maintenance and lasts longer (30-40 years vs 15-20). Treated pine is more budget-friendly but needs regular staining. We can show you both options at your estimate."
