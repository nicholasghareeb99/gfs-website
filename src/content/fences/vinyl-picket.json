  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Will a white vinyl fence turn yellow?",
      "answer": "No. Our Homeland vinyl is manufactured with titanium dioxide UV stabilizers that prevent yellowing and fading. The white stays bright for decades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is vinyl picket fence good for pets?",
      "answer": "Traditional picket spacing doesn't contain small pets. For pet containment, consider adding wire mesh behind the pickets or choosing a privacy style instead."
    },
    {
      "question": "How tall should a front yard fence be?",
      "answer": "Most Toledo neighborhoods allow 3-4 feet in front yards (open style required). Check with your HOA and review our permits page for local regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can vinyl ranch rail replace wood split rail?",
      "answer": "Yes! Vinyl ranch rail gives you the same open, country aesthetic as wood split rail but with zero maintenance and a lifetime warranty."
