    "title": "Why Northern White Cedar?",
    "content": "Northern White Cedar (Thuja occidentalis) is nature's answer to the perfect fence material. Sourced from the forests of Northern Michigan, this remarkable wood contains natural oils called thujaplicins that make it resistant to rot, decay, and insects—without any chemical treatment.",
    "additionalContent": "Unlike pressure-treated pine that relies on ACQ chemicals for protection, cedar is naturally equipped to withstand decades of exposure to rain, snow, and temperature swings. That's why our cedar fences last 30-40+ years while typical treated wood fences need replacement after 15-20 years.",

      "question": "How long does a cedar fence last in Toledo weather?",
      "answer": "Northern White Cedar fences typically last 30-40+ years in Toledo's climate. The natural oils (thujaplicins) in cedar make it extremely resistant to rot, decay, and insects without any chemical treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does cedar need to be sealed or stained?",
      "answer": "No, cedar fences do not require sealing or staining. Left natural, cedar will weather to an attractive silver-gray color. If you prefer to maintain the original golden-brown color, you can apply a UV-protective sealer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Northern White Cedar and Western Red Cedar?",
      "answer": "Northern White Cedar (what we use) has superior rot resistance and dimensional stability compared to Western Red Cedar. It shrinks only 2.2% compared to 4-8% for other woods, meaning less warping and twisting over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I stain my cedar fence immediately after installation?",
      "answer": "Yes! Unlike pressure-treated wood that requires 6-12 months to dry before staining, cedar can be finished immediately after installation."
