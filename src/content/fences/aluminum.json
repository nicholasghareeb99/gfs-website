    {
      "question": "Is aluminum fence strong enough for dogs?",

      "answer": "Yes. Our 4ft+ aluminum options meet Ohio pool safety requirements including proper picket spacing and self-closing/self-latching gate hardware. We ensure compliant installation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can aluminum fence follow slopes?",
      "answer": "Yes! Aluminum fence 'racks' to follow ground contours, making it ideal for sloped yards. Each panel adjusts to match the terrain while maintaining a consistent top line."
