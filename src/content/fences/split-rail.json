    {
      "question": "Is split rail good for keeping dogs in?",
      "answer": "Not by itself. The open design doesn't contain pets. However, we can add wire mesh backing to the rails to create a pet-proof barrier while maintaining the rustic appearance."

    {
      "question": "Should I choose cedar or locust rails?",
      "answer": "Cedar is more affordable and lasts 20-30 years. Locust is harder and more durable, lasting 30-50 years. For permanent property lines, locust is the better investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much property can split rail fence cover?",
      "answer": "Split rail is ideal for large properties. It's the most cost-effective way to fence acreage since it uses less material than privacy fencing. We regularly fence 1-10+ acre properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does split rail require maintenance?",
      "answer": "No. Split rail fence naturally weathers to a silver-gray color and requires no painting, staining, or sealing. The posts and rails will last decades without intervention."
