  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the best fence for horses?",
      "answer": "For horses, we recommend 3-rail post and rail with rounded top rail or board fencing. Avoid wire mesh alone as horses can catch legs. We can add a sight board at top for better visibility."

      "question": "How do you price large property fencing?",
      "answer": "Large property fencing is priced per linear foot. We offer volume discounts for properties over 1 acre. Split rail is most affordable, followed by post-and-rail, then board fence."

    {
      "question": "What wood lasts longest for ranch fencing?",
