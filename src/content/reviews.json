      "text": "Nick did an outstanding job installing our traditional cedar picket fence. From the start, he was incredibly patient in working through the details of our project and offered several creative solutions when we encountered challenges with our property layout. What impressed me most was how he worked within our budget constraints to find the best possible option without compromising on quality. The finished fence looks fantastic - the craftsmanship is top-notch and you can tell Nick takes pride in his work. His communication throughout the project was excellent. I'd definitely recommend Nick to anyone looking for a reliable fence contractor who delivers quality work at a fair price.",

      "text": "Hired Nick and Ghareeb Fencing Solutions. We opted for a cedar privacy fence. Nick knocked it out of the park. Price was very competitive and the job was completed on budget and on schedule. They left the yard in clean state and were happy to talk to the neighbors about what to expect with the install. 10/10 would recommend again. The fence has been up for about 6 months through winter and looks as good as when he installed it.",

He did not push vinyl on us knowing that wasn't what we wanted, unlike the other companies that quoted us. Our fencing was built from scratch, no pre-made fencing here! We cannot say enough good things about this business and the gentleman that he had working with him on our project. All of his employees were very kind and respectful. 100% a customer for life and absolutely recommend if you are looking for new fencing! Oh and he beat his competitors by over $1000.00!",
